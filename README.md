## Project Title
####  Sentiment Analysis Project

##### *Introduction*
 
In this project, we fine-tuned pre-trained Deep Learning Models such as the Roberta- -base model, and the distilbert-base-uncased Model from Hugging face on a new dataset (data) to adapt the models to the task that we wanted to solve such as the prediction of sentiment expressed in a Tweet. Then we created the Gradio app to use the models and deploy the Model and the app on the Hugging Face Platform.

###### *Objectives of The Project*

The objective of this project was:
- fine-tuning pre-trained models.
- Embedding fine-tuned Hugging Face models into Gradio App
- Hosting models on the Hugging Face platform.
- Deploying App on Hugging Face platform.

###### Features
**Sentiment Classification**: The model classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

**Easy-to-Use**: Simple API for performing sentiment analysis on custom text inputs.
**Model Accuracy**: Trained on a comprehensive dataset for accurate sentiment predictions.

#### Models Details

**Training ACCuracy**

the Training accuracies for Distilbert_base_uncased and Roberta base Model took the accuracies as follow in the table:

| *Evaluation Metrics* |*Distilbert-base-uncased*| *Roberta-base*|

| *Evaluation loss* | 0.5832209587097168 | 0.33999523520469666 |
| *Evaluation accuracy* | 0.763 | 0.7945 |
| *Evaluation runtime| 32.8662 Minutes | 13.3383 Minutes |
| *Evaluation samples per second* | 60.853 | 149.944 |
| *Evaluation steps per second* | 7.607 | 9.371 |
