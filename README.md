# Sentiment_Analysis_app
In this project, we fine-tuned pre-trained Deep Learning Models such as the Roberta- -base model, and the distilbert-base-uncased Model from Hugging face on a new dataset (data) to adapt the models to the task that we wanted to solve such as the prediction of sentiment expressed in a Tweet.
